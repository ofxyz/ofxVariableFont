// varfont_gl.h — GPU analytic glyph coverage (ImVarFont renderer layer)
//
// Owns the coverage atlas / FBOs / shaders. No Dear ImGui dependency — ImGui
// (or OF / your engine) is a host that composites GlyphTex / GlyphQuad output.
//
// Narrow GL seam between Face/morph/layout and the GPU: atlas packing, live
// pages, and multiple coverage backends in this module:
//   - signed-area accumulation (RenderGlyph, edge soup)
//   - Loop-Blinn quadratics (RenderGlyphCurves)
//   - Slug exact-curve coverage (RenderGlyphSlug)
//   - GPU morph reconstruction (UpdateMorphCurves + RenderMorphGlyph)
//
// GL entry points load via caller proc (e.g. glfwGetProcAddress); no GLEW/glad.
